![NgGH-Magic-Origins-Mod](!info/display_01.jpeg "NgGH-Magic-Origins-Mod repo: Play Battle Brothers using extraordinary character")

## Description
Added 7 new unique origins: Mage trio, Geomancer Trio, Necromancer Trio, Spellknight, Hexe and Custom Origin. And a playable non-human character system.

* Mage trio: Start with 3 mages with amazing power and a runestone. You will choose one of four runestones once the map is generated. Can hire more mages with 50% less cost. (Status: Finished)

* Geomancer Trio: Start with 3 player character geomancers who can control stone and sand as their puppet. The campaign will end if all three starting geomancers die. (Status: Finished)

* Necromancer Trio: Start with 3 random dark art users. They have a good relationship to a new undead faction and can perform resurrection ritual to create playable undead brother. (Status: Temporarily taken out for rework)

* Spellknight: Pretty much like a lone wolf start but instead of a hedge knightm you get a spellknight (Status: Temporarily taken out for rework)

* Hexe: The cream and butter of this project. A whole new origin where you can charm the enemy to become your playable character. Feel the spirit of "Gotta catch 'em all" from Pokemon, collect your enemy to form a simps army. (Status: Finished)

* Custom Origin: A origin where you can start a campaign with many more setting to customize, get the starting character you want. (Status: Hasn't finished)

Beside these origin, you can find my new mages background from villages, towns and cites though quite rare and expensive. You may also be able to recruit a hexe when accepting "Protect Firstborn" contract

There will be an upcoming new faction - The Necro Guild - where you can trade, accept new contracts. This faction is only friendly with certain origins by default, to get the permission to enter their land you must earn it. (Status: Hasn't finished)
